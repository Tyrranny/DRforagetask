# DRforagetask
Repository for the foragetask script for DR
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Download the foragetask.lic to your scripts folder.
2. Open your Setup YAML (ex:Tyrranny-setup.yaml) and add a new line for forage_container: {your bag name here}
3. In game type ;foragetask

There may be missing forage targets..... I got the level 1-10 ones, but might of missed some between 10-60 or 70. If you see one that I missed, there are instructions in the script on how to add it, but please also post a comment here letting me know so I can fix the main script.

If you find any other issues, or have suggestions, please let me know. I am new to Ruby so also please excuse the poor code :/
